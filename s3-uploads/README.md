# S3 Uploads

- Place new images in input. For now, make sure the files are named in snake case and either .jpg or .png.
- Run `make upload`.
- You can import s3 filepath strings from this directory like `import {filename} from './s3-uploads'`
  - TODO: test this. probably this js file should be sent to src.
