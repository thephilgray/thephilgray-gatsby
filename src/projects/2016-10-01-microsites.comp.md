**Lessons Learned**: I wanted the site designs to imitate the look and feel of the print designs as closely as possible while also being fully responsive. I learned responsive typography techniques to capture the essence of the print design on different screen sizes and when aspects of print design don't translate well onto the screen. Also, I learned the value of CSS class naming and module organization conventions.
